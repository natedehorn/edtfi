			<div class="col-md-12">
				<p>The Eating Disorders Task Force of Indiana, founded in 1988, is a nonprofit organization of multidisciplinary treatment professionals in the area of eating disorders. We believe that eating disorders are complex, multidimensional disorders that involve social-cultural, psychological, medical and nutritional factors. They also reflect developmental and family issues. We believe that treatment should be provided by professionals trained and experienced in the area of eating disorders and should address contributory factors in as many dimensions as possible.</p>

				<h2 class="page-header">Our mission</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-12">
				<p>We promote a healthy balance of body, mind and spirit and the ability to question societal values as crucial  to counter our culture's excessive focus on appearance and weight. We see this as necessary both in treatment and in prevention activities directed at residents of Indiana who may be vulnerable.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Thus, our function as a group is predicated on:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Exchanging treatment information, identifying referral sources, discussing current issues relevant to the field, and promoting multidisciplinary expertise among task force members.</li>
					<li>Disseminating education information to the public in forms such as brochures, videos, workshops, and media information.</li>
					<li>Providing informational and treatment resources in forms such as conferences, workshops, consultations, and use of print, computer, telecommunications, and other mediums.</li>
					<li>Developing and providing primary and secondary prevention resources within the state of Indiana.</li>
					<li>Promoting ethical standards of practice.</li>
					<li>Advocating for patients and for treatment providers.</li>
